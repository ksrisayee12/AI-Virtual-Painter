# AI VIRTUAL PAINTER 

THIS IS AN AI PROJECT WHICH WORKS ON THE BASIS OF YOUR HAND GESTURES SEEN ON THE CAMERA. WITH TWO FINGERS YOU CAN USE THE SELECTION MODE AND WITH ONE FINGER YOU CAN USE THE DRAWING MODE WHICH DRAWS ON THE SCREEN DISPLAYED. YOU CAN USE THE SELECTION MODE TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE BRUSH.
<br>
CHANGE THE BRUSH THICKNESS AND ERASER THICKNESS IN LINE 6 & 7 
```py
brushThickness = 20
eraserThickness = 60
```
THIS IS THE DEFAULT BRUSH AND ERASER THICKNESS SHOWN UP

SOME TIMES THE `VirtualPainter.py` FILE WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR WEBCAM. IN SUCH CASE USE THE `WebcamPaint.py` FILE. THE OUTPUT WILL LOOK LIKE A LOW QUALITY IMAGE BUT IT WILL WORK. BUT THE IT WILL LAST FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES AFTER IT WILL GIVE ERROR
